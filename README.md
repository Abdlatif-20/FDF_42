# FdF
## About

FdF is a project in which we convert a file with a grid of height values into a 3d wireframe using a simple graphics library called MiniLibX.

## Installation

The program can be build with a simple `make` to make a mandatory part

And `make bonus` to make a bonus part

## Examples

### Simple example of functionality
The following is an example of a .fdf file we use as an input for our program:
```
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0 10 10  0  0 10 10  0  0  0 10 10 10 10 10  0  0  0
0  0 10 10  0  0 10 10  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 10 10  0  0

0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
```
which produces the following:
