### Simple example of functionality
The following is an example of a .fdf file we use as an input for our program:
```
0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
```
which produces the following:
